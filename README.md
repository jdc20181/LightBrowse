**Important Notice**

LightBrowse is in a Testing phase - Support including updates will be revaluated in 2018. 


**Features**

LightBrowse is a independent Sub-project of BeffsBrowser, what this means is, it can be ran right beside BeffsBrowser, licensed seperately, and so forth, but is still under the BeffsBrowser roof. Its like a feature of BeffsBrowser, but ran in its own shell. Below

**^**

Favorites: Favorites is limited in LightBrowse, as it is thought if you want a lot of features you would use BeffsBrowser instead, and just not use 
the extras. The concept is Browsing only focused. 

Settings: Settings can help customize your experience, limited settings in light browse will mean, very minimal customizing, as with more settings
the app becomes bigger, which isn't the concept of the product. 

Minimum OS: Light Browse is starting with a Newer framework meaning compatibility to Windows 7 is limited, so I have decided not to support Windows 7 and older OS versions

StartPage: A New version of Startpage called LightPage, will work similar to Startpage without custom sites. You will have several quick sites to choose from. 




**Dependents**

*BeffsBrowser TabControl* - Comes from the BeffsBrowser Respo

*Gecko* - Powerful under the hood component of the mechanics of browsing.
