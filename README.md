**^**

Favorites: Favorites is limited in LightBrowse, as it is thought if you want a lot of features you would use BeffsBrowser instead, and just not use 
the extras. The concept is Browsing only focused. 

Settings: Settings can help customize your experience, limited settings in light browse will mean, very minimal customizing, as with more settings
the app becomes bigger, which isn't the concept of the product. 

Minimum OS: Light Browse is starting with a Newer framework meaning compatibility to Windows 7 is limited, so I have decided not to support Windows 7 and older OS versions
